## Installation
To use this project, first, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smmousavi8872/CHDPrediction.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd CHDPrediction
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start using the project. Here's a brief overview of the typical workflow:

Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset for training. You can use the provided datasets or replace them with your own.
Feature Engineering: Perform feature engineering techniques such as normalization, scaling, encoding, etc., to prepare the features for modeling.
Model Training: Train machine learning models using the prepared data. Various algorithms and techniques can be explored for better performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate metrics to assess their performance and generalization capabilities.

## Prediction 
Use the trained models to make predictions on new data or test datasets.

## Data
This project includes sample datasets (data.csv, test_data.csv) containing features and labels related to CHD prediction. You can use these datasets for experimentation or replace them with your own data.

## Models
The repository contains implementations of various machine learning models for CHD prediction. You can find these models in the models directory. Feel free to explore, modify, or extend these models based on your requirements.
